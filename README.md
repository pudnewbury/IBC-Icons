#### Using the icon font

The `fonts` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project.

To use the icon font on a website 1) copy the CSS code in “style.css” to your own CSS file and 2) copy the “fonts” folder to your root website folder. Make sure that the uploaded fonts are linked from the imported CSS and properly placed in “fonts/”.

An icon can be inserted with the following HTML code:

```html
<i class="ibc-osmo"></i>
```

The classes are referred to styling definitions in the included CSS file:

```html
.ibc-osmo:before {
content: “\e90e”;
}
```
